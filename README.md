# 'Long Stairs' Background
Long Stairs is a DnD style dungeon setup that features in the [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) books, where two locations are bridged by a staircase called the 'Long Stairs'. As you ascend, difficulty increases, and encounters in rooms become more challenging. To progress you have to pass through 'rooms', each with doors leading into further rooms. SOme of these are marked, som are not, but all have a probability to lead you to the next landing. The 'landings' are rooms consistent between run-throughs with distinct environments.

Turns out [Gwern also thinks this is probably a good idea](https://gwern.net/cyoa)

# Andralet's Intro
- Program for Long Stairs map generation. Prints some inspiration for DM as well.
- Maps are generated in JSON format to be rendered via deepnight.net map generator (see https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/).

I've done this thing mostly for personal use but it's pretty simple, so you won't have much trouble figuring out how it works.

NOTICE:
Texts are done in Russian, because my players know it better (and because I'm too lazy to make translations for everything).
Some troubles shall have 18+ mark (e.g. a requirement to sing obscene songs in some rooms). Better modify them, if you want to play with children. And don't say I didn't warn you!
